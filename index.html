<h1>Project on Console</h1>

<br>
<h3>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft.

<h3>What exactly is the console?
    In Windows terms, a Console is a textual GUI window that you see when you run "cmd.exe". 
    It allows you to write text to, and read text from, a window without the window having any other UI chrome.
    To acess the console screen, you right click and then click on inspect. Then a little window pops up and then you press console.</h3>

        console.log("Hi this is my first console screen");
        var firstname="Devikshaa";
        console.log(firstname);
        var lastname="Jain";
        console.log(lastname);
      var fullname= firstname.concat(lastname);
      console.log(fullname);
      var lengthfullname =fullname.length;
      console.log(lengthfullname);
      var name1="I am Devikshaa J.";
